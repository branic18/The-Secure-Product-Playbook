SDLC (Software Development Lifecycle) - the "big picture" software creation processâ€”automatically and continuously.

SDL (Secure Development Lifecycle)- SDL is a security-first mindset applied to every SDLC phase.
Also called secure software development life cycle (SSDLC)
Purpose: prevent vulnerabilities while developing
Including application security practices such as threat modeling, secure coding practices, and security testing
Security Lifecycle-

CI/CD (Continuous Iteration, Continued Delivery)- the engine that pushes code through

ðŸ§  Analogy:
SDLC is the roadmap for building software.
SDL is the seatbelt and airbags added to ensure the trip is safe.
CI/CD is the car engine that automates and accelerates the journey.

Admin level:
Provisioning and deprovisioning- This is when the administrator gives a user account temporary access to resources and actions, then when that action is finished, removing user access. This lessens the risk exposure if the system were to be hacked
SDLC- operational tasks
SDL- critical, security-focused activities
